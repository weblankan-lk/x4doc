// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Demolition there two teams. Attackers and defenders.
//
// Attackers need to plant a bomb at the other team's bombsites and defend it so it's
// not defused by the defenders.
//
// Defenders need to defend their bombsites to prevent the attackers from planting 
// the bomb and defuse it in case they do accomplish to plant it.
//
// Round ends when both bomb positions are exploded, or roundlength time is reached
// Map ends when one team reaches the score limit, or time limit or round limit is reached
// Players respawn upon death
